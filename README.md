# Covid-19_Game

This is a Java game I made about social distancing at University. I made this game while I was in lockdown during Covid-19 so it seemed fitting at the time.

The game took me around a month to make and I used entirely Java to do it, the aim was that you spawning in then was chased by red sqaures. The longer you was touching the squares the longer you took damage, when your HP reached 0 you lose. I added a scoreboard in that tracks the scores.
